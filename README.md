DESCRIPTION:
In this 2.5D side-scrolling slender-esque/scuffed horror game, 
you play as an angler fish in the depths of the sea amongst 
the remains of sunken ships and forgotten treasures. There are 
various keys scattered around the map that are all necessary to
unlocking the treasure chest. What lies within the chest? Dabloons,
money, TREASURE, maybe booty perhaps? There is only one way to
unlock the mysteries of Davey Jones' Locker in our hit game 
Anglin' For Booty.

CONTROLS:
W: move up
A: move left
S: move down
D: move right

ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS:
 - PARTICLE SYSTESM
	- multiple bubble particle systems
	- ambient ocean dust particle system
 - 5 MEANINGFUL IMPORTED OBJECTS
	- playable angler fish model
	- sunken ship model
	- sunken pirate ship model
	- key models
	- wrecked row boat model
	- rock asset pack
	- whale model
 - CONTROLLABLE CHARACTER
	- The angler fish is the main character
	  of our game. Our game features a 
	  third-person perspective.
 - SINGLE, FLICKERING LIGHT SOURCE THAT MOVE WITH THE PLAYER
	- The angler fish's esca (aka "lure") moves with
	  the playable character and has a slow animation
	  that flickers. The angler has an emissive material
	  and a point light that have a synced animation.
 - 5 "CLUES" HIDDEN IN THE SCENE
	- Our game features 5 keys that are scattered
	  throughout the map that are neccessary for
	  unlocking the treasure chest which the end
	  condition for our game.
 - FINDING ALL CLUES TRIGGERS AN EVENT
	- After finding all 5 keys the treasure chest will
	  unlock and reveals inmeasurable amounts of gold
	  and treasure. Maybe it beholds even more perchance?
	  Maybe? Possibly? Will we ever know?
 - POLISHED/GAME READY
	- INTERESTING OBJECTS/MATERIALS
		- We found various sunken ship models, rock models,
		  a treasure chest model, and a nice angler fish model
		  that facilitates a cohesive scene.
	- SENSIBLE LIGHTING
		- The only lighting within our scene is the one
		  generated from the angler fish itself. This created
		  a really dark environment that resembles the deep ocean.
	- NO DEFAULT SKYBOX/GREY MATERIALS
		- Our game features a deep ocean skybox
	- USE OF POST-PROCESSING EFFECTS
		- Used a global volume that uses bloom and vignette to create
		  a dark atmosphere for a deep sea effect.
	- COMPELLING ENVIRONMENT
		- We leveraged using alot of great models, a compelling skybox,
		  bubble and dust-like particle systems, post-processing to darken
		  the overall atmosphere, and simple enviroment models to create
		  a deep sea playspace.
